				p Hi, I'm Scotty - I live in Brooklyn with my amazing girlfriend Amany and our also amazing dog <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/zigzaglarry/">Larry</a>.

				p I work at <a href="https://learnvest.com">LearnVest</a>, where I help to architect design systems across our User Interfaces, and build the software that breathes life into them. I also teach web-engineering courses at the <a href="http://nycda.com">New York Code &amp; Design Academy</a>. In both places, I'm lucky to be surrounded by awesome, passionate people.

				p I love CSS, comprehensive testing, continous delivery, and squeaky-clean code. I'm also big on biking, trees, and family time. When I'm not coding, I'm usually at a dog park.
